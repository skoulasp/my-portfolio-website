To stay current with the evolving front-end landscape, I adopted React, one of the leading front-end libraries, which has further refined my skills and ensured my adaptability in todayâ€™s fast-evolving tech ecosystem.",
            "Given the widespread use of WordPress as the worldâ€™s leading CMS, I also invested time in understanding WordPress theme development. This expertise allows me to deliver custom solutions tailored to client needs while applying the best front-end web development practices. Iâ€™m highly committed to creating unique, custom WordPress themes that blend technical precision with creative design.",
